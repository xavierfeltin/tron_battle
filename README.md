# tron_battle
Local version of tron battle to test bot algorithms for Tron Battle in Codingame (Monte Carlo Tree Search approach)

Exploratory:
At the moment the coefficients were determined on my intuition and the ranking on Codingame.
Add a genetic algorithm for trying to improve the coefficients used in the scoring function in the actual code used in Codingame (Legend).
